-- db/local/cleanup-demo-design-data.sql · LOCAL DEV ONLY — deletes the rows that
-- db/local/demo-design-data.sql hand-inserted (the OLD, pre-API "design-preview" seed).
--
-- WHY: db/local/demo-design-data.sql predates money entirely (no order_items money columns'
-- siblings some screens now expect) and uses FIXED, hand-picked ids (the `d0000...` / `44444444-...`
-- literals) that are NOT real uuidv7 — orders is uuidv7-partitioned and PRUNE-checked, so a
-- detail lookup by id on one of these rows misses its partition and the app shows
-- "This order is unavailable". The same rows have no order_items/ledger money columns
-- populated the way the real API does, so prices/amounts/earnings render "—". And because
-- scripts/demo-seed/run.mjs (the NEW api-driven seeder) creates its OWN "Onion — Medium Grade"
-- and "Red Chilli — Teja (Organic)" listings under slightly different titles than this old file's
-- "Onion — Medium grade" / "Red Chilli — Teja Premium", the seeder's title-based idempotency check
-- (GET /v1/listings?mine=true&q=<title>) never matches the old file's rows — so BOTH sets of rows
-- persist side by side → Onion ×2, Red Chilli ×2 in the buyer browse / farmer listings feed.
--
-- THIS SCRIPT removes ONLY the exact rows demo-design-data.sql inserted (matched by their fixed,
-- hand-picked ids — every id below is copy-pasted from that file, not guessed) plus the two rows
-- (`mandi_prices` where source='demo_design') it manages by DELETE+re-INSERT. It never touches:
--   • rows created by the real API / scripts/demo-seed/run.mjs (those get real uuidv7 ids —
--     structurally impossible to collide with the fixed ids listed here)
--   • anything the founder created by hand through the app
--   • the demo tenant itself (88888888-0000-7000-8000-000000000001) or shared reference data
--     (roles/units/categories/products/mandis/schemes) — other real rows may still reference them
--
-- ORDER (FK-safe, children before parents):
--   reviews → order_items → orders → bids → auctions → scheme_applications → worker_profiles →
--   notifications → learning_resources → mandi_prices(source=demo_design) → mandis(demo ids) →
--   listings → products(demo ids) → user_tenant_roles(demo memberships) → users(demo cast)
--
-- IDEMPOTENT: every DELETE is scoped to an explicit id list (or an id LIKE 'd0000%' pattern that
-- only ever matched this file's rows) — running this twice, or against a DB where these rows were
-- already removed, is a no-op (0 rows deleted second time), never an error.
--
-- NEVER run in staging/production (there is no legitimate reason these ids would exist there).
--
-- RUN IT as the DB owner (same role that ran demo-design-data.sql):
--   psql "postgres://<owner>:<pw>@localhost:5432/krishiverse" -f db/local/cleanup-demo-design-data.sql
