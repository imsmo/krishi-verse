## Golden Paths
- New feature → copy the module blueprint (see CLAUDE.md), wire flag, ship dark.
- New DB change → db/migrations/NNNN_description.sql via PR.
- Local dev → `docker compose up` then `pnpm dev`.

## Scale Story (why this structure survives billions of operations)
Stateless apps (scale = add pods) · all heavy work in worker queues (scale =
add consumers) · money isolated in wallet-service (scale/harden independently)
· modules are extraction-ready microservices (move folder → new app, keep
contract) · DB pre-partitioned/sharded-ready (see Database_Architecture docs)
· country = a cell (re-deploy whole stack per region, Phase 4+).
