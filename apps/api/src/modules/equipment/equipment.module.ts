// modules/equipment/equipment.module.ts
// Equipment & CHC (PRD M20): the farm-machinery RENTAL marketplace. An equipment owner / Custom Hiring
// Centre lists assets + rate cards; a renter requests a job, the owner quotes a deposit, the renter
// confirms (the advance is ESCROWED), the operator starts the meter (OTP-gated), completes with measured
// usage, and the owner SETTLES — the escrow is released to the owner, any shortfall collected from the
// renter, any unused hold refunded — all zero-sum, idempotent via the wallet boundary (Law 2). Gated by
// the `equipment` feature flag (default OFF).
//
// SCOPE (this build): equipment assets + per-asset rate cards + rental bookings (escrow hold → OTP start →
// usage-metered completion → escrow release/refund/collect settlement) + the confirm-timeout job.
// DEFERRED (schema in 0010, not wired): DRONES (registrations / pilots / flights, DGCA DigitalSky + RPL
// expiry jobs + no-fly/weather pre-flight gate), maintenance logs, GPS area-trace (±2%) precise billing,
// operator-pool integration (operator_user_id from labour), and the payments payout/intent linkage
// (settlement here moves in-platform wallet balances).
