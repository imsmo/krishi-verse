// modules/dairy/dairy.module.ts
// Dairy (PRD M16): the MILK PROCUREMENT spine for cooperatives/MCCs. A cooperative runs Milk Collection
// Centres, enrols farmer members, defines quality-based rate cards, records twice-daily collections
// (priced float-free), and SETTLES per-cycle milk bills — paying each farmer the NET through the wallet
// boundary (tenant 'main' → farmer userMain, txnType 'milk_payment', zero-sum + idempotent — Law 2).
// Gated by the `dairy` feature flag (default OFF).
//
// SCOPE (this build): MCC centres + memberships + milk rate cards (pricing engine) + milk collections
// (partitioned) + milk bills (generate→preview→approve→pay) + the cycle-close job.
// DEFERRED (schema in 0009, not wired): BMC cold-chain units + IoT temperature watch, cooperative
// governance (share registers / resolutions / votes), D2C subscriptions + deliveries, adulteration-pattern
// scan, D2C route planning, Lactoscan analyzer ingestion, and BANK-DISBURSEMENT payout (payout_id) — the
// current settlement credits the farmer's in-platform wallet; bank withdrawal rides the payments payout path.
