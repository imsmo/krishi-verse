// modules/identity/jobs/kyc-expiry-reminders.cadence-job.ts
// KV-BL-P0-9-follow-on — wraps the existing (previously-unwired) KycExpiryRemindersJob as a
// `ScheduledJob` so `core/jobs/jobs.runner.ts` can run it on a nightly cadence inside apps/api,
// mirroring `SettlementStatementsCadenceJob` (modules/payments/jobs/settlement-statements.cadence-job.ts).
// See `kyc-expiry-reminders.job.ts` for the job itself — unchanged, this class only wires it in.
//
// THE CROSS-TENANT DRIVER LOOP (wave-1 flagged this as the blocker: "needs a cross-tenant driver loop
// that doesn't exist yet"): unlike SettlementStatementsJob, which scans every tenant's un-statemented
// lines in ONE query against the runner's shared BYPASSRLS pool, KycExpiryRemindersJob.runForTenant
// is RLS-scoped PER TENANT — it goes through UnitOfWork.run(tenantId, ...), which sets app.tenant_id
// as a local GUC and routes to that tenant's shard writer pool (see core/database/unit-of-work.pg.ts).
// There is no single cross-tenant SQL query that can do this job's work. So this driver:
//   1. enumerates every live tenant (status trial|active|grace, not soft-deleted) from the runner's
//      kv_relay (BYPASSRLS) pool — the only pool this class ever touches directly, purely to LIST
//      tenant ids (tenants itself carries no tenant_id column, so BYPASSRLS is just the pool this
//      runner happens to hold, not a security-relevant escalation);
//   2. calls KycExpiryRemindersJob.runForTenant(tenantId, days) once per tenant, via its own
//      DI-injected UnitOfWork/OutboxWriter (unrelated to the pool param — same as any other
//      request-path caller of this job would);
//   3. isolates one tenant's failure from the rest (same isolation guarantee ScheduledJobsRunner
//      gives one JOB relative to another — this extends it to one TENANT relative to another within
//      a single job's tick).
//
// WHY THIS IS PILOT-RELEVANT (not GA-deferred): identity's bank-KYC gate (S4) populates
// kyc_documents.valid_until for verified docs and now BLOCKS payout/bank-account flows on expiry —
// without this reminder job, a seller's KYC silently lapses with no nudge until a gated action fails
// outright. The domain logic already existed (KycExpiryRemindersJob, idempotent per due-document via
// the outbox) and was simply never scheduled.
