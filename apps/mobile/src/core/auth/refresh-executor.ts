// apps/mobile/src/core/auth/refresh-executor.ts · pure, framework-free factory for the REACTIVE refresh-on-401
// executor the auth store registers with the API client (see ../api/client.ts's registerRefreshExecutor and
// packages/sdk-js/src/http.ts's onUnauthorized). Kept dependency-injected and React/expo-free — mirrors
// session.reducer.ts's split of "pure decision logic" from the React shell — so the retry/sign-out branching is
// unit-testable without a React Native test harness (this app's jest.config.js scopes to framework-free
// src/core/__tests__ only; RN screens run under jest-expo in CI).
//
// Context: access tokens expire in 900s. Before this executor existed, the ONLY refresh was the boot-time
// proactive one in auth.store.tsx — once a token expired mid-session, every request 401'd until the app
// restarted. This executor is what the SDK calls reactively on a 401 (at most once per request, single-flighted
// across concurrent 401s — see http.ts's `refreshOnce`).
