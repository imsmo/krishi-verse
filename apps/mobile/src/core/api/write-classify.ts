// apps/mobile/src/core/api/write-classify.ts · the ONE place an offline-first write decides "is this a real
// connectivity problem, or a real answer from the server?" Every offline-first mutation (listing.create,
// media.upload, …) should classify through here instead of re-deriving its own HTTP-status heuristic — that
// duplication is exactly how KV-MF-02 happened: apps/mobile/src/features/listings/listings.api.ts computed
// `(e as { status?: number }).status ?? 0` and treated status 0 (the default for ANY error without a `.status`
// property — which includes every non-SdkError exception, not just true network errors) as "queue it, offline".
// A founder saw "Saved. It will publish when you're back online" while FULLY ONLINE because a real failure (a
// 4xx/5xx SdkError, or an unrelated post-success throw) fell through that same catch-all. The fix is narrow and
// literal: only `SdkNetworkError` (and its subclass `SdkTimeoutError`) means "the request never reached the
// API" — that is the ONLY condition that should ever be silently queued instead of surfaced to the farmer.
