// apps/mobile/src/features/labour/skill-picker.ts · PURE logic for the worker Add-a-Skill screen (137). No React /
// no SDK I/O (SDK types `import type` → erased) → unit-tested. It flattens the labour skill catalogue into pickable
// rows (emoji + name from the REAL lookups, reusing worker-skills.skillEmoji) and marks the worker's current
// selection. Save replaces the whole skillIds set via labour.updateWorker (the real contract). The design's
// per-skill DAILY-RATE RANGE (₹350-450/day) has NO field in the skill catalogue, so it is NOT assembled here (§13 —
// omitted, never fabricated); years-of-experience has no worker-profile field either, so it is captured in the
// screen and flagged, never faked into a contract.
