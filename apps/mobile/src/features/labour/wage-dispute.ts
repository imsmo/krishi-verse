// apps/mobile/src/features/labour/wage-dispute.ts · PURE logic for the worker Wage-Dispute screen (143). No React /
// no SDK I/O → unit-tested. There is no labour-specific dispute endpoint yet, so the report is filed as a SUPPORT
// TICKET (support.openTicket, idempotent) — which carries only {subject, severity}. The detailed description,
// photo/voice attachments and a claimed "received" amount have NO ticket field, so they are captured + flagged
// (not sent) rather than faked (§13). The AGREED wage shown is real (from the booking); "received" is the worker's
// claim, not a system value, so the screen never prints a fabricated received figure.
