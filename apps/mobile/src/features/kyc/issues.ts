// unit-tested. Builds the "what to fix" list from the caller's REJECTED KYC documents: each carries a real
// server-written rejection reason + (optionally) its doc-type id, which we resolve to a real name from the
// catalogue. §13: nothing here is fabricated — an issue exists only if the server rejected a real document.
