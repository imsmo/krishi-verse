// apps/mobile/src/features/kyc/selfie.ts · PURE helper for the KYC selfie/liveness step (173). No React/native —
// unit-tested. The app captures a selfie and submits it as a KYC DOCUMENT; the actual liveness + Aadhaar-photo
// FACE-MATCH is a server/provider capability (Law 11 — the app never asserts a match). This helper only resolves
// which seeded KYC doc-type the selfie should be filed under, by matching its code — never fabricating an id.

 * no selfie/photo type — the screen then honestly degrades (no submit under a wrong type). Pure. */
