# Mobile Phase-1 screen backlog (196 screens)

Source of truth: `../../Phase-1 all screen design/Krishi_Verse_Design_System/screens/*.html` (196 final designs).
This file maps every screen group to its app location and build status, so the remaining verticals can be picked
up one at a time against the same foundation (ui-native + core + expo-router) shipped this release.

Legend: ✅ built this release · 🟡 partial · ⬜ scaffolded (folder exists, screens to build).

## Cross-cutting infrastructure still to wire (folders present as documented placeholders)
- ✅ `core/voice` — on-device STT for the Speak-to-Sell flow (locale map + dictation hook + VoiceButton wired into
  create-listing, behind `voice_listing`). Pending: server LLM extraction of crop/qty/price; TTS.
- `core/push` — FCM registration + notification routing.
- `core/location` — GPS + geofence (delivery, mandi proximity).
- `core/offline/sqlite` + `sync.engine` — durable read cache + bidirectional sync (the write queue is built).

Each vertical follows the pattern shipped here: a `features/<area>` data layer on the SDK (degrade-never-die,
idempotent mutations, offline-queue for writes), screens under `src/app/(role)/…`, money via `MoneyText`
(bigint minor), i18n keys (not literals), and unit tests for any non-trivial pure logic.
